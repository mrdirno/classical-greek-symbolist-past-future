**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from Philo's perspective, detailing his first day in the cistern and the fragment that broke his old life.
- Create a 'memory-vision' triggered by a newly discovered symbol fragment—describe the primal scene it reveals.
- Draft a confrontation between Elara and the 'Architect of Silence,' the mysterious overseer of the Prism.
- Write a letter from Lykos, searching for his vanished wife, that slowly reveals the cracks in their 'anchored' world.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a visual system for the 'old language' symbols—a non-linear, emotive script that conveys concepts, not words.
- Build an interactive 'Cistern Simulator' where users can drag a hook through a dark pool to retrieve and assemble symbolic fragments.
