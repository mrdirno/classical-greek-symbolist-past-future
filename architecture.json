  "cover_prompt": "A woman in a tattered, classical chiton reaches out with reverence to touch luminous, three-dimensional symbols—geometric shapes and archaic glyphs—that float like solidified memory in the stagnant air of a vast, forgotten cistern, her fingers causing ripples of light in the dark water at her feet, the ancient brickwork covered in a softer, organic growth of crystalline structures that pulse with a faint internal light. The scene is one of profound discovery and latent power within a submerged, sacred space, where the physical substance of forgotten history hangs in the air, suggesting both the weight of the past and the potential energy of a future waiting to be rewritten. In the atmospheric and mythic style of Anselm Kiefer, with the textured materiality and symbolic depth of a Zdzisław Beksiński landscape, rendered in the medium of thick, expressive oil paints and mixed media with layers of meaning and decay. Book cover framing, centered and intimate composition viewed from a low angle to emphasize the towering, glyph-filled space and the solitary figure's awe, creating a sense of monumental scale and personal revelation. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting where the only illumination emanates from the glowing symbols themselves, casting long, stark shadows and highlighting the textures of wet stone and fabric, within a color palette of deep umbra, oxidized bronze, and ethereal, prismatic golds and sapphire blues. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
